    <p> It was the dawn of the third age of mankind, ten years after the Earth-Minbari war. The Babylon project was
        dream
        given form. Its goal: To prevent another war by creating a place where humans and aliens could work out
        their
        differences peacefully. It's a port of call; home away from home for diplomats, hustlers, entrepreneurs, and
        wanders. Humans and aliens wrapped in two million five hundred thousand tons of spinning metal, all alone in
        the
        night. It can be a dangerous place, but it's our last best hope for peace. This is the story of last of the
        Babylon stations. The year is 2258. The name of the place is Babylon 5.

            The ships on Babylon 5 were brilliant, many of them seeming to be physical manifestations of the aliens
            using them.
            But nothing beats the idea of a race of bad guys whose ships look like spiders – giant, black, jagged
            spiders flying
            through space and killing innocent people. They even died like spiders, with their legs crinkling up
            into a
            dead-spider-like ball! It’s as if our primal fears built themselves vessels and flew into space.
