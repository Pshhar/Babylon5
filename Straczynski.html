    <div class="three">
        <div class="box box22">
            1: He was the first person ever to write an entire season of a television show himself: all 22 episodes of
            season
            three. It was a mind-boggling feat and yet, despite what must have been an extraordinarily punishing
            schedule,
            the quality of that season is unimpeachable.
        </div>

        <div class="box box23">
            2:He paved the way for digital FX on TV. It wasn’t the first show to use them, but it was the first show to
            use
            them so extensively, and to use them to create “realistic” virtual sets on a regular basis.
        </div>

        <div class="box box24">
            3:He was a fan of the cartoon He-Man and the Masters of the Universe. He wrote a spec script and sent it
            directly to Filmation.
            They purchased his script, bought several others, and hired him on staff.
        </div>

        <div class="box box25">
            4:He was a story editor for the He-Man spinoff She-Ra: Princess of Power, and he worked on jayce and the
            Wheeled
            Warriors.
        </div>

        <div class="box box26">
            5:He wrote 92 of Babylon 5's 114 episodes
        </div>

        <div class="box box27">
            6:He planned the entire story arc from the beginning. He kept a written copy of it on a 200-page encrypted
            computer file.
        </div>

        <div class="box box28">
            7:As as he was writing each character, he built a “trap door” into their
            background in order to facilitate the actor’s easy removal from the show.
        </div>

        <div class="box box29">
            8:When he was working up the idea for a science fiction series,he began from an interesting standpoint:
            budget.
            He vowed to try and create a science fiction show that could keep costs to a minimum,That budgetary
            mindset
            is what sparked the idea for a show set on a
            space station.
        </div>

        <div class="box box30">
            9:He wanted to create a universe where humanity was still mired in the flaws of our past, where things
            like
            greed
            and infidelity were rampant.
        </div>

        <div class="box box31">
            10:He enforced some interesting rules for the show. Episodes were written six episodes in advance, and once
            production was started, no changes were allowed to be made
            to the script.
