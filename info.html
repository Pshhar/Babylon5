        my thoughts on babylon5...
        <br>
        as a teenager i watched babylon five with wonder and it got me hooked on scfi, i have since watched the show
        6 times from start to finish and every time i learn something new.
        Babylon 5 has everything you could want in a tv show and i have never found it boring or repetitive like some
        shows.I have always lifted my feet off the floor because i have a deep fear of spiders so watching Babylon five
        in a dark room was fun when the shadow ships appeared on the screen.
        I liked that every race including humans had history, good and bad and every race had problems to overcome.
        michael straczynski did a fantastic job on babylon 5 and i do not think anyone could ever produce another show
        of
        the same quality again.
        Season 3 is my favourite season and i love all the lasers and the cgi even if it is dated now it was still
        amazing back then.
        well thats my 2pence worth on babylon5 hope you like the site.
